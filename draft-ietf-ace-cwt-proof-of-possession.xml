	By including a <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> (confirmation) claim in a CWT,
	the issuer of the CWT declares that the presenter possesses a particular key
	and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm that
	the presenter has possession of that key.
	The value of the <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> claim is a CBOR map
	and the members of that map identify the proof-of-possession key.
      </t>
      <t>
	The presenter can be identified in one of several ways by the CWT
	depending upon the application requirements.
	If the CWT contains a <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> (subject) claim <xref target="CWT"/>,
	the presenter is normally the subject identified by the CWT.
	(In some applications, the subject identifier will be relative to
	the issuer identified by the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> (issuer) claim <xref target="CWT"/>.)
	If the CWT contains no <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> claim,
	the presenter is normally the issuer identified by the CWT
	using the <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx> claim.
	The case in which the presenter is the subject of the CWT is analogous to
	Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os"/> SubjectConfirmation usage.
	At least one of the <spanx style="verb">sub</spanx> and <spanx style="verb">iss</spanx>
	claims is typically present in the CWT and
	some use cases may require that both be present.
      </t>

      <section title="Confirmation Claim" anchor="Confirmation">
	<t>
	  The <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> claim is used in the CWT
	  to contain members used to identify the proof-of-possession key.
	  Other members of the <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> map may be defined because
	  a proof-of-possession key may not be the only means of confirming
	  the authenticity of the token.
	  This is analogous to the SAML 2.0 <xref target="OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os"/>
	  SubjectConfirmation element in which a number of different
	  subject confirmation methods can be included
	  (including proof-of-possession key information).
	</t>
	<t>
	  The set of confirmation members that a
	  CWT must contain to be considered valid is context dependent
	  and is outside the scope of this specification.
	  Specific applications of CWTs will require implementations
	  to understand and process some confirmation members in particular ways.
	  However, in the absence of such requirements, all confirmation members
	  that are not understood by implementations MUST be ignored.
	</t>
	<t>
	  This specification establishes the
	  IANA "CWT Confirmation Methods" registry for these members
	  in <xref target="CnfReg"/> and registers the members defined by this specification.
	  Other specifications can register
	  other members used for confirmation, including other members for

	  confirmation values defined below may be present.
	  Note that if an application needs to represent multiple proof-of-possession
	  keys in the same CWT, one way for it to achieve this is to
	  use other claim names, in addition to <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx>,
	  to hold the additional proof-of-possession key information.
	  These claims could use the same syntax and semantics
	  as the <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> claim.
	  Those claims would be defined by applications or other specifications
	  and could be registered in
	  the IANA "CBOR Web Token Claims" registry <xref target="IANA.CWT.Claims"/>.

      <section title="Specifics Intentionally Not Specified" anchor="NotSpecified">
	<t>
	  Proof of possession is often demonstrated by having the presenter sign
	  a value determined by the recipient using the key possessed by the presenter.
	  This value is sometimes called a "nonce" or a "challenge".
	</t>
	<t>
	  The means of communicating the nonce and the nature of its contents
	  are intentionally not described in this specification,

	  Likewise, the means of communicating the signed nonce is also not specified,
	  as this is also protocol specific.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Note that another means of proving possession of the key

	  The means of obtaining a key for the recipient is likewise protocol specific.

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        All of the security considerations that
        are discussed in <xref target="CWT"/> also apply here.
        In addition, proof of possession introduces its own unique security issues.
	Possessing a key is only valuable if it is kept secret.
	Appropriate means must be used to ensure that unintended parties
	do not learn private key or symmetric key values.
      </t>
      <t>
	Applications utilizing proof of possession SHOULD also utilize audience restriction,
	as described in Section 4.1.3 of <xref target="JWT"/>,
	as it provides different protections.
	Proof of possession can be used by recipients to reject messages from unauthorized senders.
	Audience restriction can be used by recipients to reject messages intended for different recipients.
      </t>
      <t>
	A recipient might not understand the <spanx style="verb">cnf</spanx> claim.
	Applications that require
	the proof-of-possession keys communicated with it
	to be understood and processed MUST ensure that
	the parts of this specification that they use are implemented.
      </t>
      <t>
	Proof of possession via encrypted symmetric secrets is subject to replay attacks.
	This attack can, for example, be avoided when a signed nonce or challenge is used
	since the recipient can use a distinct nonce or challenge for each interaction.
	Replay can also be avoided if a sub-key is derived from a shared secret
	that is specific to the instance of the PoP demonstration.
      </t>
      <t>
	As is the case with other information included in a CWT,
	it is necessary to apply data origin authentication and integrity protection
	(via a keyed message digest or a digital signature).
	Data origin authentication ensures that the recipient of the CWT
	learns about the entity that created the CWT
	since this will be important for any policy decisions.
	Integrity protection prevents an adversary from changing
	any elements conveyed within the CWT payload.
	Special care has to be applied when carrying symmetric keys inside the CWT
	since those not only require integrity protection
	but also confidentiality protection.
      </t>
      <t>
	As described in Section 6 (Key Identification) and Appendix D (Notes on Key Selection)
	of <xref target="JWS"/>, it is important to make explicit trust decisions about the keys.
	Proof-of-possession signatures made with keys
	not meeting the application's trust criteria MUST NOT not be relied upon.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Privacy" title="Privacy Considerations">
      <t>
	A proof-of-possession key can be used as a correlation handle if the same key
	is used with multiple parties.
	Thus, for privacy reasons, it is recommended that different proof-of-possession keys
	be used when interacting with different parties.

	(e.g., "Request to Register CWT Confirmation Method: example").
	Registration requests that are undetermined for
	a period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's attention
	(using the iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for resolution.
      </t>
      <t>
	Criteria that should be applied by the Designated Experts include
	determining whether the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
	determining whether it is likely to be of general applicability
	or whether it is useful only for a single application, and
	evaluating the security properties of the item being registered
	and whether the registration makes sense.
      </t>
      <t>
	It is suggested that multiple Designated Experts be appointed who are able to
	represent the perspectives of different applications using this specification
	in order to enable broadly informed review of registration decisions.
	In cases where a registration decision could be perceived as
	creating a conflict of interest for a particular Expert,
	that Expert should defer to the judgment of the other Experts.
